# Sankey Diagrams

Rendered at: https://kierandriscoll.github.io/js-sankeys/

This uses an organisations heirarchy to demonstrate a D3 network diagram. Clicking on a 'node' toggles a tooltip which shows additioanl information about the node.

All the 'nodes' must be unique - eg. you cant have more than one perosn with the same name.

The CSV must also be ordered in a certain way for the code to work correctly.
